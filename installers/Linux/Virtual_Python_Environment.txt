Virtual Python 3.9.7 Environment
============================================================
File Linux_Python397_requirements.txt in the folder "installers/Linux" can be
used to create a Python virtual environment suitable for running NRAP-Open-IAM.
Note that the requirements file assumes that Python 3.9.7 is installed on the machine.

You may want to start with updating pip to ensure you have the latest version.
We recommend to use the system pip to update a user installation of pip:

	python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip

1. To create a virtual environment navigate to the NRAP-Open-IAM root folder
and type in the terminal

	python3 -m venv env

This will create a folder "env" folder within the NRAP-Open-IAM root folder
to hold a virtual Python installation. (Package venv is part of the Python
standard library and does not require additional installation.)

2. Activate just created virtual environment "env" by typing

	source env/bin/activate

This will activate the "env" environment and prepares your system
for the installation of the required Python packages.

3. Type

	pip install -r Linux_Python397_requirements.txt

This will install all Python packages needed for the proper work of NRAP-Open-IAM.

4. Test the Python and NRAP-Open-IAM setup by following directions provided
in the "Installation_Instructions_Linux.txt" file.

5. In order to return to your default Python environment type

	deactivate

If you want to return to the virtual environment "env" simply follow the activation step 2 above,
from the NRAP-Open-IAM root folder.
You do not need to recreate the virtual environment (step 1).

Note: Before testing and working with NRAP-Open-IAM make sure that the proper environment is activated.

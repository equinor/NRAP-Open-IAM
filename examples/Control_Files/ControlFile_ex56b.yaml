# OpenIAM Control File Example 56b
#
# This example is similar to example 56a, the stratigraphy is different and
# it uses more options. This example is meant to demonstrate how one can choose
# to set up certain sections of a control file using the area of review (AoR)
# Workflow while leaving other sections to be automatically set up by
# the Workflow. Here, the aquifer component is entered manually and
# 'AutomateAqCompSetup' (under Workflow: Options) is set to False. Although
# the OpenWellbore component has not been set up manually, the aquifer component
# needs to have input for the Connection entry. Components that are set up
# automatically through a Workflow will always have a name combining
# the component type name and  "1". As a result, the aquifer component
# is set up to connect with "OpenWellbore1."
# For the AoR Workflow, users only need entries for one reservoir component,
# one wellbore component, and one aquifer component, so the names will never
# need additional indices ("2" or "3"). Additionally, the aquifer component is
# included in the Components entry under ModelParams. Components that are set
# up by the Workflow will be added automatically to the 'Components' list under
# ModelParams, but any components set up manually need to be included in the
# 'Components' list. Because the default setting for the AoR Workflow assumes
# that a GenericAquifer component is being used, users must also specify
# 'AquiferComponentType: FutureGen2Aquifer' under 'Workflow: Options'.
# The aquifer component type dictates what kinds of metrics the AoR Workflow
# looks for (pH_volume and TDS_volume for FutureGen2Aquifer vs.
# Dissolved_CO2_volume and Dissolved_salt_volume for GenericAquifer),
# so failing to specify the aquifer component type here will result in an error.
#
# The Plots section is also set up manually. The creation of an overall AoR
# (i.e., one that reflects all metrics) through the AoR Workflow requires
# the .csv files that are saved by the AoR plot type. If users set up the Plots
# section manually, they must include one plot for each of the required
# metrics (here, pressure, CO2saturation, pH_volume, and TDS_volume),
# and they must have 'SaveCSVFiles' set to True for each of the AoR plots.
# The pressure AoR plot (Plot1) does not include a critical pressure entry,
# so the .csv file saved will not have critical pressures values.
# If the critical pressures are in that .csv file, they will be read
# from there during the AoR Workflow. Otherwise, the AoR Workflow itself
# will calculate the critical pressure values (the default setting is
# 'CriticalPressureMPa: Calculated' under 'Workflow: Options') and consider
# the critical pressures when delineating the overall AoR.
#
# Note that the results of this example are identical to example 31a.
# This approach is meant to show how the AoR Workflow can replicate results
# from a standard control file. Additionally, that example does not produce
# an overall AoR that reflects all metrics.
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#   python ../../source/openiam/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex56b.yaml

# OpenIAM Control File Example 35
#
# This example is similar to the example Control File Example 34. Please refer
# to the description for that example. This example, however, has units that dip
# to the south. This example demonstrates how the units can pinch out
# if their depths become too small. Note, however, that each unit can only
# be reduced to a minimum depth of 1 m: the unit is still there, it is just very
# thin. This example also uses the option "PlotStratComponents: True" within
# the Stratigraphy Plot. When using the option "spatiallyVariable: strikeAndDip"
# within the Stratigraphy section, the code actually creates a separate stratigraphy
# component for every other component (e.g., each OpenWellbore).
# The unit thicknesses for each stratigraphy component are calculated based
# on the component's location and the strike and dip values used.
# The component for which the stratigraphy component was made is then given
# the parameters of the newly created stratigraphy component. The wellbores
# are plotted as vertical lines, and the unit depths along each wellbores
# are plotted as red or blue circles (for the tops of shales or aquifers,
# respectively). By varying the ViewAngleElevation and ViewAngleAzimuth values,
# this example is meant to further demonstrate the stratigraphy created with
# the strike and dip option. The options "PlotWellLabels: False"
# and "StrikeAndDipSymbol: PlotSymbol: False" are used so that the markers
# representing unit depths can be seen more clearly. Additionally,
# having "PlotInjectionLocations: True" makes the code plot the injection sites
# used by the reservoir components. Note that injection sites must be explicity
# given with the InjectionCoordx and InjectionCoordy (x and y values, respectively)
# for LookupTableReservoir components. Other types of reservoir components store the
# x and y values, so InjectionCoordx and InjectionCoordy do not need to be provided.
# For more details check Control File example 37. This example also demonstrates how
# one can save the Stratigraphy plot as a certain type of image file (here, .tiff).
#
# There are also three StratigraphyColumn plots demonstrating how unit thicknesses
# change across the domain. The top units pinch out to the north - because both shale
# 3 and aquifer 2 have thicknesses of 1 m for StratCol3, the labels for those
# units would overlap each other. To prevent that overlap, the labels have
# been provided as blank ('') entries. See control file example 33b for more details
# regarding unit labels. Because the text used to display depths would also overlap,
# this text is disabled in StratCol2 and StratCol3 with the entry "DepthText: False".
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#   python ../../source/openiam/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex35.yaml

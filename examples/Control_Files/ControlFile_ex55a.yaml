# OpenIAM Control File Example 55a
#
# This example demonstrates the use of the Workflow section in a control file.
# The Workflow section can be used to run several specific analyses. For example,
# while the AoR plot type shows results for one metric at a time (e.g., pressure,
# CO2saturation, pH_volume, or TDS_volume), the AoR Workflow can automatically
# run each of these AoR plots and then compile the results into a single AoR
# figure that reflects each of the metrics. The name of this figure is set by
# the entry 'AoRFigureName' under 'Options'.
#
# A Workflow is intended to allow complex analyses with minimal input from
# a user. For example, a user could choose to only provide inputs for
# the LookupTableReservoir component (i.e., data from reservoir simulations
# for the GCS site) and then let all other options resort to defaults (including
# the parameter values for each component). The 'Stratigraphy' and
# 'ModelParams' sections are still required, however. The Workflow will
# save a .yaml file that includes all of the component and plot entries
# that were setup automatically. This .yaml file will have the same name
# as the .yaml file used but with "_WorkflowSetup" included at the end.
# The Workflow section will also be removed from this new .yaml file, so that
# a simulation run with the file would not add all of the components again,
# making redundant copies.
#
# Control files with Workflow entries are different from other control files
# because the Workflow can automatically set up the component and plot entries -
# user does not have to set up the components and plots themself. Users can
# set up those sections manually if they set certain options to False
# (AutomateResCompSetup for the reservoir component, AutomateWellCompSetup
# for thewellbore component, AutomateAqCompSetup for the aquifer component,
# and AutomatePlotsSetup for the Plots section). The default setting for these
# entries are True, so by default the Workflow section will assume users has
# not set up those sections. For pressures to be used in the delineation of
# an overall AoR, a critical pressure must be used. A specific critical pressure
# can be given through the 'CriticalPressureMPa' entry (in MPa), but the default
# setting is 'CriticalPressureMPa: Calculated'. A calculated critical pressure
# is obtained with the normal approach used by the OpenWellbore component
# (see the documentation for the OpenWellbore component).
#
# If user does not provide any input under the 'Options' entry in the Workflow
# section, default options will be used. For example, the default approach
# is to have a LookupTableReservoir component using the FutureGen2 .csv files.
# If user has not downloaded those files and put them in the correct location
# (see below), this example will produce an error. The options that are
# normally entered in the section for a LookupTableReservoir component can be
# entered under ReservoirOptions (e.g., FileDirectory and ParameterFilename).
# The default wellbore type is OpenWellbore - that is currently the only
# wellbore type allowed for AoR analyses, but that could change in future
# updates. The default aquifer component type is GenericAquifer. The wellbore
# locations are set with the Locations entry under 'WellboreOptions' (with same
# format as the normal Locations entry for wellbore components). If no wellbore
# locations are provided, the LookupTableReservoir .csv files are used to set
# the locations (with default settings of thin_point_density: True,
# min_x_spacing: 20000, and min_y_spacing: 20000 - see Control File example 32a).
# The wellbores will leak to the aquifer specified with the 'AquiferName'
# entry under 'Options'. The aquifer component will also be set up to represent
# that aquifer. If AquiferName is not given, the default setting is 'aquifer2'.
# Parameter values for the reservoir, wellbore, and aquifer components
# can be entered under the 'Parameters' sections under the 'ReservoirOptions',
# 'WellboreOptions', and 'AquiferOptions' entries, respectively. These
# parameter inputs can be given with min and max values for simulations
# using the lhs or parstudy analysis types. This simulation uses the forward
# analysis type, however.
# The 'Controls' entries under 'WellboreOptions' can be used to set how
# the wellbore handles critical pressures (e.g., see Control File example 31a).
# If these entries are not provided, the default settings are
# 'critPressureApproach: True' and 'enforceCritPressure: False'.
#
# Note that with the setup used here, the results are identical to those
# of control file example 32a. That example does not produce an overall
# area of review, however. Additionally, a control file using a Workflow
# section can allow for more convenient changes (e.g., user does
# not need to change a component's name in multiple locations, like the
# Components list, the component entry itself, or any Connection entries).
#
# This example requires the additional FutureGen 2.0 data set.
# FutureGen 2.0 data set can be downloaded from the following source:
# https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/futuregen-2-0-1008-simulation-reservoir-lookup-table
#
# The downloaded data set should be placed here:
#     source/components/reservoir/lookuptables/FutureGen2/1008_sims
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#   python ../../source/openiam/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex55a.yaml

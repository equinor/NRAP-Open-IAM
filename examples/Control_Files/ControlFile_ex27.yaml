# OpenIAM Control File Example 27
#
# This example demonstrates reading temperature data with a LookupTableReservoir.
#
# This example uses a modified version of the file Reservoir_data_sim01.csv from the
# Kimberlina data set (https://gitlab.com/NRAP/Kimberlina_data). The file
# was placed in the following location:
#     source/components/reservoir/lookuptables/Test_metrics
#
# The file from the Kimberlina data set was modified to include columns
# for the fields temperature_1 through temperature_10 (corresponding to
# the times in columns 1 through 10 of the time_points.csv file in the same
# folder). These temperature columns all have a constant value of 50 (degrees
# Celcius). This example also uses a modified version of
# the parameters_and_filenames.csv file. This edited version
# (parameters_and_filenames_read_temperature.csv) was also placed in the
# Test_metrics folder. The file has only one entry corresponding to the file
# Reservoir_data_sim01_read_temperature.csv. The parameters are unchanged
# from the Kimberlina data set, however (logResPerm: -13.3,
# reservoirPorosity: 0.215, logShalePerm: -18.7).
# If the above files are not present, this example will produce an error.
# Although the temperature data are constant, this approach would also work
# on any metrics that vary over space and time. Note that to incorporate
# the temperature data from the .csv files into the system model, 'temperature'
# must be included in the Outputs section of the LookupTableReservoir component.
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#   python ../../source/openiam/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex27.yaml

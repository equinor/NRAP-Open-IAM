# OpenIAM Control File Example 54a
#
# This example demonstrates the use of the GriddedRadialMetric plot type.
# This plot type is designed for component output that is defined on a radial
# grid. The output is defined by the radius and depth coordinates, where radius
# is the distance from the location associated with a given component.
# The GenericAquifer component produces dissolved salt and dissolved CO2 mass
# fractions that are defined on a radial grid. The sections of the grid
# that have mass fractions exceeding one of the thresholds used
# dissolved_salt_threshold and dissolved_co2_threshold) are included
# in the corresponding plume volumes.
#
# The GriddedRadialMetric plot type shows the map-view evolution of dissolved
# salt or dissolved CO2 mass fractions. Note that for displaying output
# from a GenericAquifer, the outputs of the GenericAquifer must include
# r_coordinate, z_coordinate, and the gridded radial output being used
# (Dissolved_CO2_mass_fraction or Dissolved_salt_mass_fraction).
# The names of components producing the output must be entered under
# ComponentNameList (here, [GenericAquifer1]). Additionally, the name
# of the gridded radial observation to be used must be entered under MetricName.
# For the GenericAquifer component, this entry can be Dissolved_salt_mass_fraction
# or Dissolved_CO2_mass_fraction.
#
# These map view figures can be made for all times (enter 'All' for TimeList;
# 'All' is the default setting). Otherwise, specific times can be entered
# as a list (e.g., [2, 5, 10] for years 2, 5, and 10). A figure will be made
# for each time point specified. Additionally, the user must specify the depths
# at which the radial data is to be evaluated. Depths are provided to the
# 'ZList' entry. Note that for the 'ZList' entry, depths beneath the
# surface are taken as negative. Specific depths can be entered in meters
# (e.g., [-750] or [-750, -775, -800]). For each depth entered, the plot
# will use the closest depth from the component's radial grid. Alternatively,
# one can provide strings corresponding with unit depths. For example, one
# of the plots uses 'ZList: [aquifer2Depth, shale3Depth]'. In NRAP-Open-IAM,
# a shale or aquifer's bottom depth is specificed as shale#Depth or aquifer#Depth,
# where # is the unit number. Because shale 3 is right above aquifer 2,
# the depths evaluated are the top and bottom of aquifer 2. One figure will
# be made for each depth and each specified time.
#
# The 'DegreeInterval' entry specifies the interval (degrees) to use when
# displaying the gridded radial output. This entry can be 1, 5, 15, 30, or 45.
# If 'DegreeInterval' is not provided, the default value is 15 degrees.
# The 'EqualAxes' option specifies whether the x and y axes (distances east and
# north, respectively) should be made to cover the same distances.
# If 'EqualAxes: False' is used , the output will look elongated
# in the x or y direction. The default setting is True. 'FigureDPI' specifies
# the dots-per-inch (DPI) to use for the figure (default: 100). The option
# 'PlotInjectionSites' specifies whether the injection site(s) will be shown
# (default: False). Note that when using a LookupTableReservoir and
# 'PlotInjectionSites: True', the injection site locations must also be provided
# with InjectionCoordx and InjectionCoordy (see Control File example 37).
# The limits for the x and y axes (distances east and north, respectively)
# can be set with SpecifyXandYLims, xLims, and yLims (in meters), as shown here.
# If the limits are not provided, each graph will have x and y limits that
# extend far enough to encompass the features included (component location
# and injection site(s)) as well as all output data exceeding MinValue (see below).
#
# One of the most important entries for the GriddedRadialMetric
# plot type is MinValue. The figures made will only show values that are
# greater than the mass fraction (dimensionless) provided by MinValue.
# At time t = 0 years, all dissolved salt and dissolved CO2 mass
# fraction values from the GenericAquifer will be 0. At times > 0 years,
# however, these values are very small but nonzero.
# For example, the dissolved CO2 mass fractions can be about 5.0e-3 at
# the highest radii evaluated by the GenericAquifer component (about 78 km).
# The dissolved salt mass fractions can be as low as 1.0e-30 at the
# highest radii. The GenericAquifer component defines plumes as the
# volumes with dissolved CO2 and dissolved salt mass fractions exceeding
# a specified threshold (dissolved_co2_threshold and dissolved_salt_threshold,
# which have default values of 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). If the MinValue
# provided is 0, all of the figures will be zoomed out to show the small
# concentrations extending to largest radii. For these figures to be useful,
# one should specify a MinValue that is large enough to enable the figure to focus
# on the area of interest (e.g., near the component's location) but small enough
# to not exclude too much of the output data. We recommend using a MinValue of
# 0.002 when evaluating Dissolved_salt_mass_fraction (10 times lower than the
# default dissolved_salt_threshold of 0.02) and 0.01 when evaluating
# Dissolved_CO2_mass_fraction (equal to the default dissolved_salt_threshold
# of 0.01). If MinValue is not entered, these values will be used as the
# defaults for the corresponding output type (dissolved salt or dissolved CO2).
# If at all times the evaluated output does not exceed the MinValue, then one figure
# will be made. This figure has a title that includes 'All Model Times.'
# To enhance the contrast between locations with and without values above
# MinValue, the figure background is gray. If at all times the evaluated output
# is below or equal to MinValue, then the entire figures will be gray, with
# the component's location shown as a black circle.

# OpenIAM Control File Example 16
#
# This example demonstrates the use of the PlumeStability component.
# The PlumeStability component uses the same type of .csv files as
# those used by the LookupTableReservoir component. By analyzing changes
# in pressure and CO2 saturation over time in these files, the PlumeStability
# component can produce a variety of metrics describing the changes in
# pressure and CO2 saturation plumes over time (e.g., plume areas, velocity of
# the plume centroid, direction in which a plume is moving, and the direction in
# which the dispersion of the plume occurs). The plumes are defined by areas
# exceeding the values presented in the 'Thresholds' entry (here, a pressure of
# 1 MPa and a CO2saturation of 0.01).
#
# Note that LookupTableReservoir and PlumeStability components can both accept
# additional outputs other than pressure and CO2saturation (e.g., temperature).
# The outputs of the PlumeStability component can be named to track whatever
# metric is stored in the .csv files used (e.g., including 'temperature: 20'
# in the Thresholds entry and producing outputs of temperature_areas and
# temperature_mobility).
# Control file examples 27 and 28 demonstrate how to include other metrics in
# the .csv files used for LookupTableReservoir and PlumeStability components.
#
# Note that the PlumeStability component does not connect with the Stratigraphy
# component, so it will ignore the information entered under Stratigraphy.
#
# This example requires the additional Kimberlina data set.
# Kimberlina data set (pressure-in-pa-kimb-54-sims.zip or
# Pressure_In_Pa_Kimb_54_sims.zip) can be downloaded from one of the following places:
# 1. https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/nrap-open-source-iam
# 2. https://gitlab.com/NRAP/Kimberlina_data
#
# The downloaded data set should be placed here:
#    source/components/reservoir/lookuptables/Kimb_54_sims
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#   python ../../source/openiam/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex16.yaml

# OpenIAM Control File Example 31a
#
# This example demonstrates the use of the AoR plot type. To use the AoR plot,
# you must have OpenWellbores distributed across the area of interest.
# There are multiple ways of doing that, and this example uses the 'range' option.
# The OpenWellbore component illustrates setup of the 'range' option, which
# contains 'xmin', 'xmax', 'dx', 'ymin', 'ymax', and 'dy'. Number of wellbores is
# calculated from the number of points made with the 'range' option.
# The placed OpenWellbores are hypothetical and only used to assess the aquifer
# contamination that could happen if a leakage pathway was present. The spatial
# extent of such impacts is meant to inform the definition of an Area of
# Review (AoR). Note that while pressure and CO2saturation results from reservoirs
# can be displayed in an AoR plot, these results show the conditions within
# the reservoir rather than aquifer impacts. The OpenWellbore components are
# placed with the 'grid' option, which contains 'xmin', 'xmax', 'xsize',
# 'ymin', 'ymax', and 'ysize'.
#
# Note that having 'GenerateOutputFiles': False and 'GenerateCombOutputFile': False
# within the ModelParams section will prevent the creation of individual output
# and combined outputs files. The combined outputs files can be large
# due to the number of components used. In this example there is one
# SimpleReservoir, OpenWellbore, and FutureGen2Aquifer created for each
# x and y value specified with the 'grid' option, and an output file
# would be created for each conmponent. Additionally, the AoR plot type creates
# a csv file with the data used for the plot, and this csv file is much smaller
# than the combined and individual output files.
#
# Both wellTop (in the OpenWellbore component) and depth (within
# the FutureGen2Aquifer component) should reflect the depth to the
# bottom of the aquifer being examined for the AoR (here, aquifer 2).
#
# Note that the PlotInjectionSites, FigureDPI, and SaveCSVFiles entires for
# the AoR plots are optional. If those entries are left out, the figure
# will use the default settings where injection sites are not plotted
# (PlotInjectionSites: False), the figure dots-per-inch (dpi) is 100
# (FigureDPI: 100), and .csv files are saved (SaveCSVFiles: True). To
# demonstrate that these entries are optional, they have all been excluded
# from the AoR plot of CO2saturation. When using a LookupTableReservoir,
# the injection site will only be plotted if InjectionCoordx and InjectionCoordy
# entries are also provided. See Control File example 32a.
#
# Note that because the entry for the OpenWellbore component includes a
# Control section containing critPressureApproach: True, leakage through
# the OpenWellbore can only happen if the reservoir pressures exceed the
# critical pressure of the aquifer receiving leakage. The critical pressure (Pcrit)
# is calculated as Pcrit = (rho_w * g * d_aq) + (rho_br * g * (d_res - d_aq)).
# Here, rho_w is the density of water (1000 km/m^3), g is 9.81 m/s^2, d_aq is
# the bottom depth of the aquifer (m), rho_br is the brine density (kg/m^3),
# and d_res is the depth to the top of the reservoir (m). The critical pressure
# is therefore sensitive to the brineDensity value used - higher brine densities
# generally lead to higher critical pressures and lower leaked masses of brine
# and CO2. Note that flow through an OpenWellbore can happen beneath the critical
# pressure if a CO2 plume is present in the reservoir at the base of the well
# (i.e., buoyancy effects from the CO2). If you include 'enforceCritPressure: True'
# in the 'Controls' section and also provide a value for the critPressure parameter
# (in Pa), the critical pressure will be taken as the critPressure parameter.
# Otherwise, the default approach is to calculate critical pressure.
#
# A critical pressure can be shown in a pressure AoR figure by including
# 'CriticalPressureMPa: Calculated' or 'CriticalPressureMPa: X' (where X is a
# value in MPa). If that entry is included, the figure specifies whether
# the pressures exceeded the critical pressure and highlights the locations with
# pressure equal to the critical pressure with a red contour (if that value
# is within the domain - e.g., there is no contour if all pressures exceed
# the critical pressure). When using the 'Calculated' option, the code
# calculates the critical pressure for all OpenWellbore components and uses
# the lowest value. This approach is used because critical pressures can vary
# if spatially variable stratigraphy is used, but the AoR plot is only set up
# to display one critical pressure value. The pressure results saved
# to .csv files can be used to make figures incorporating a spatially variable
# critical pressure, however. Additionally, there are additional considerations
# for the use of the 'CriticalPressureMPa: Calculated' option in lhs or
# parstudy simulations (see Control File example 31d).

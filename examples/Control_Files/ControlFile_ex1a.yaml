# OpenIAM Control File Example 1a
#
# This example links a SimpleReservoir component to a CementedWellbore component.
# Based on the pressures and CO2 saturations provided by the SimpleReservoir,
# the CementedWellbore component calculates the leakage rates from 4 leaky wellbores.
# The leakage enters aquifers 1 and 2 as well as the atmosphere.
#
# This example produces three plots. The first two plots show the CO2 leakage
# into the intermediate aquifer (aquifer1) and the shallow aquifer (aquifer2).
# The third plot shows the reservoir pressures at the wellbore locations. Each
# plot has different outputs in separate subplots through the inclusion of
# 'Use: True' under the 'Subplot' entry. The 'NumCols: 2' entry in each plot
# specifies that each plot will have two columns of subplots. The subplot rows
# are determined as the number required to show the number of outputs included
# (here, two rows, so there are four subplots for four locations).
#
# In the plot Pressure_plot, the subplot titles are specified through the inclusion
# of 'COMPONENTNAME.OUTPUTNAME: SUBPLOT TITLE' under the 'Subplot' entry. In the
# control file interface, the component name is a combination of what the user
# provides ('SimpleReservoir1') and a location index preceeded by an underscore
# and containing three digits ('_000'). For example, the formatting of
# 'COMPONENTNAME.OUTPUTNAME' here leads to 'SimpleReservoir1_000.pressure' for the
# pressure at location 0 (the indexing starts at 0). If subplot titles are not
# specified, they are generated based on the data shown.
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#  python ../../source/openiam/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex1a.yaml

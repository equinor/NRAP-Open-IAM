# OpenIAM Control File Example 22
#
# This example illustrates the setup of a Chemical Well Sealing component.
# Although the output from a Chemical Well Sealing component cannot be
# displayed with plot types like TimeSeries, the output from this example
# (seal_flag: boolean indicating whether the fracture sealed; seal_time:
# time at which the fracture sealed in seconds, or 0 s if it does not seal)
# will be saved in .csv files).
# Note that although this example is setup with EndTime: 2 the Chemical Well
# Sealing component model is called only once. This means that for all 3 time points
# 0, 1, and 2 years the saved results would be the same: these results only reflect
# whether the evaluated fracture will seal. For the parameter values used
# here, the fracture does seal (seal_flag = 1) and the seal_time is about
# 1.76e+05 seconds, or about 2 days. A seal_time value of 1.76e+05 is displayed
# for each of the three time steps (0, 1, and 2 years).
# Note that a Chemical Well Sealing component is not impacted by the stratigraphy
# information entered. This component type does not connect with a Stratigraphy
# component.
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):

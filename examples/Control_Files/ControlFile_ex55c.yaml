# OpenIAM Control File Example 55c
#
# This example demonstrates the use of the Workflow section
# with minimal user input. While all options are specified in
# example 55a, here the options are allowed to resort to their
# default settings. Only the 'Type' entry for the Workflow section
# is provided here - this entry is required to use a Workflow.
# The default options are to use a LookupTableReservoir component
# (.csv files are required, see below), OpenWellbores using the x
# and y locations from the .csv files (and z locations, if the table
# includes them), and GenericAquifer components. Note that simulation
# run times can be especially long when using GenericAquifer components,
# so the user may need to limit the number of wellbore locations used.
# The default approach is to do so with the 'thin_point_density: True'
# setting, with min_x_spacing: 20000 and min_y_spacing: 20000. See
# Control File example 32a for an example of this approach. If 'AquiferName'
# is not included under 'Workflow: Options:', the default setting is
# the shallowest aquifer (here, 'aquifer4'). Because this example does not
# include 'AquiferName', the wellbores will leak to aquifer 4; the aquifer
# component will be set up to represent aquifer 4, and the area of
# review analysis will be conducted for aquifer 4.
#
# This example requires the additional FutureGen 2.0 data set.
# FutureGen 2.0 data set can be downloaded from the following source:
# https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/futuregen-2-0-1008-simulation-reservoir-lookup-table
#
# The downloaded data set should be placed here:
#    source/components/reservoir/lookuptables/FutureGen2/1008_sims
#
# To run this file, use the command (\ for Windows / for Mac or Linux):
#   python ../../source/openiam/openiam_cf.py --file ControlFile_ex55c.yaml

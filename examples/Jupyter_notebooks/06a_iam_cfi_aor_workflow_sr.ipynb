    "This example demonstrates how to use the AoR plot type in the Control File Interface. Specifically, this example examines the setup of the .yaml file for Control File Example 56d (ControlFile_ex56d.yaml) as well as the example's output. The figures and .csv files produced show the extent of pressure and CO$_2$ saturation plumes within reservoir resulting from the injection operation as well as the aquifer impact that could occur if hypothetical open wellbores (i.e., uncemented) were distributed across the domain. By examing the pressure, saturation, and different aquifer impact metric plumes that could arise if open leakage pathways were present (a worst-case scenario offering a conservatively high portrayal of leakage risks), one can use the results to inform the extent of the site's AoR.\n",
    "\n",
    "The present control file example creates a map-view figure showing where reservoir pressures exceed the local critical pressure (i.e., the pressure required to drive brine leakage into the aquifer considered given the parameters and stratigraphy used). Another figure shows the TDS plume volumes that could occur in the aquifer if leakage pathways were present. The AoR Workflow also creates an overall AoR reflecting different metrics (pressure and CO$_2$ saturation in the reservoir as well as pH and TDS plume volumes in the aquifer considered, aquifer 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that before this example can be run, one need to have the OpenIAMEnv environment activated (environment containing the python libraries required to run NRAP-Open-IAM - see the installation .txt files in the 'installers' folder). For example, one can open Anaconda Prompt, use the command \"conda activate OpenIAMEnv\" to activate the environment, navigate to the directory for NRAP-Open-IAM, and then use the command \"jupyter notebook\" to open Jupyter Notebook from that directory and within that environment. Then, the jupyter notebook examples will have access to the Python libraries within NRAP-Open-IAM environment."

Control files will typically use the pound symbol followed by hyphens (#---) to mark separate sections, but these characters are not required. Any symbols following a pound symbol (#) will be ignored by the Python script that reads the .yaml file, so the pound symbols and hyphens are only there to provide some comments or divide the control file into logical parts. \n",

    "Every control file must have a section called 'ModelParams'. In this section, one specifies the model times to assess ('EndTime: 20' and 'TimeStep: 1.0', times are in years), the type of analysis to conduct (i.e., deterministic or stochastic, controlled by the 'Analysis' entry), the names of the components included in the system model ('Components'), and the output directory to save the output ('OutputDirectory').\n",

The list of components is actually empty ('Components: [ ]'); this approach is not typical for a control file, and only works when using a Workflow that can automatically handle such matters.

    "The only other section the control file contains is the Workflow section. In the control file interface, a Workflow can automate the setup of components and plots. In contrast, in a normal control file one must manually set up the sections for each component and plot. Workflow automation was created to minimize the effort required to run specific analyses. The delineation of AoRs is likely to be a common usage of NRAP-Open-IAM, so this analysis should be as convenient as possible. Additionally, this automation can prevent the occurence of common errors. For example, in a common control file the user must type component names in multiple locations (e.g., in the 'Components' list in the 'ModelParams' section, in the component's own section, and in the sections for any connected components). A typo or a slight formatting error could cause the simulation to fail.\n",

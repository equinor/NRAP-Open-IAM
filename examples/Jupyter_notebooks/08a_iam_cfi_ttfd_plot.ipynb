    "This example demonstrates how to use the TTFD plot type in the Control File Interface. Specifically, this example examines the setup of the .yaml file for Control File Example 40 (ControlFile_ex40.yaml) as well as the example's output. The figures and .csv files produced show (1) how dissolved CO$_2$ plumes (areas with a relative change in dissolved CO$_2$ concentration > 20 %) change in two aquifers in a simulation with 30 stochastic realizations, (2) the times at which the monitoring wells provided (through x, y, and z coordinates) could detect these plumes, and (3) the probability that a dissolved CO$_2$ plume forms in different regions of the aquifers."

    "First, we review the different sections of the .yaml control file. Control files typically use the pound symbol followed by hyphens (#---) to mark separate sections, but these characters are not required. Any symbols following a pound symbol (#) will be ignored by the Python script that reads the .yaml file, so the hyphens are only there as a visual aid. Every control file must have a section called 'ModelParams'. In this section, one specifies the model times to assess ('EndTime: 15' and 'TimeStep: 1', times are in years), the type of analysis to conduct (i.e., deterministic or stochastic, controlled by the 'Analysis' entry), the names of the components included in the system model ('Components'), and the output directory to save the output ('OutputDirectory'). Here, the analysis type is lhs ('type: lhs'), which stands for Latin Hypercube Sampling. This lhs simulation will use 30 stochastic realizations ('siz: 30'). Each entry is followed by a colon (:) followed by input. Some entries take a single input value (e.g., 'EndTime: 15.') or a list of input values ('Components: [LookupTableReservoir1, MultisegmentedWellbore1, FutureGen2AZMI1, FutureGen2AZMI2]'). Some entries have other entries indented beneath them; the indented entry is on a lower line and preceeded by an additional four spaces (e.g., 'type' and 'siz' are indented beneath 'Analysis')."

NRAP-Open-IAM
=============
This is the prototype NRAP Phase III Integrated Assessment Model (NRAP-Open-IAM).
To use the NRAP-Open-IAM, download and extract the folders, then open
the User_Guide.pdf in the root folder.  To download the NRAP-Open-IAM click on
the download icon in the lower right section of the header information
next to the Clone button.
The download icon looks like: ![gitlab download image](https://gitlab.com/NRAP/OpenIAM/-/wikis/uploads/ec2d7d5cb2b0c45d5b61e69acccfc8cc/download_icon.PNG)

From the menu that appears select the preferred compressed folder
data type. The download will have the current repository hash as part of the
folder name, feel free to rename the folder something simple
such as "OpenIAM".

Additionally, the archive of the tool can be obtained through
NETL's Energy Data eXchange website: https://edx.netl.doe.gov/dataset/nrap-open-source-iam
by requesting an access through e-mail addressed to NRAP@netl.doe.gov.

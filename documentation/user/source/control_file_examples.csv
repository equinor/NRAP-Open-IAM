ControlFile_ex1.yaml,"Simple reservoir, cemented wellbore",Forward simulation. The saturation and pressure output produced by simple reservoir model is used as input for cemented wellbore model. The example produces three plots. The first two plots is of the |CO2| leakage rates into the intermediate aquifer (aquifer 1) and the shallow aquifer (aquifer 2). The third plot is of the pressure in the reservoir at the wellbore locations.
ControlFile_ex2.yaml,"Simple reservoir, multisegmented wellbore","Latin hypercube sampling, 30 realizations. A fixed seed can be specified for the sampling setup: symbol # before the seed has commented it out. This example shows an alternative way to specify wellbore locations inside the wellbore component specification with the ``Locations`` keyword."
ControlFile_ex3.yaml,"Simple reservoir, multisegmented wellbore, carbonate aquifer","Latin hypercube sampling, 30 realizations. Example illustrates use of known and random wellbore locations."
ControlFile_ex4.yaml,"Simple reservoir, open wellbore, carbonate aquifer","Latin hypercube sampling, 30 realizations. Example demonstrates several plotting options: ``TimeSeries``, ``TimeSeriesStats``, and ``TimeSeriesAndStats``. For analysis of the large number of realizations a user might find it more helpful to plot the time series statistics rather than the data for each realization using ``TimeSeriesStats`` plotting option. ``TimeSeriesAndStats`` plots the simulated values and the related statistics. The ``subplot`` keyword can be used to present some of the results in subplots."
ControlFile_ex5.yaml,"Simple reservoir, cemented wellbore",Example is used to demonstrate parameter study analysis.
ControlFile_ex6.yaml,Lookup table based reservoir,"Latin hypercube sampling, 10 realizations. To run this example, the additional *Kimberlina* data set have to be downloaded and unzipped into the *source/components/reservoir/lookuptables/Kimb_54_sims* folder. The data files can be downloaded from the same EDX directory where the NRAP-Open-IAM was downloaded or from https://gitlab.com/NRAP/Kimberlina_data. The  data set comes from simulation work done by Wainwright et. al. :cite:`Wainwright2012`."
ControlFile_ex7a.yaml,Multisegmented wellbore,"Latin hypercube sampling, 30 realizations. Example illustrates the use of dynamic input to drive a wellbore model without attaching a reservoir model. This functionality can be used to quickly evaluate behavior of a single component model with a fixed input or interactions between several component models without constructing a full systems model. In the example the dynamic input is provided as a list of pressure and |CO2| saturation data at the simulation time points."
ControlFile_ex7b.yaml,Multisegmented wellbore,"Latin hypercube sampling, 30 realizations. Example illustrates the use of dynamic input to drive a wellbore model without attaching a reservoir model. In the example the dynamic input is provided as a path to the file containing pressure and |CO2| saturation data at the simulation time points."
ControlFile_ex8.yaml,"Simple reservoir, open wellbore, carbonate aquifer","Latin hypercube sampling, 1000 realizations. Example demonstrates the use of the ``Analysis`` section to compute correlation and sensitivity coefficients and create visualizations of the analysis results. Each subsection of the ``Analysis`` section shows all available options for the user to control (required inputs are marked as such)."
ControlFile_ex9.yaml,"Simple reservoir, open wellbore, atmospheric ROM","Latin hypercube sampling, 30 realizations. The AtmosphericROM model simulates |CO2| dispersion in the atmosphere as a dense gas leak. Example illustrates two plotting options available only for the AtmosphericROM model. ``AtmPlumeSingle`` keyword can be used to plot the critical distance from leakage points for a single realization. For multiple Monte-Carlo simulations probability of being within a critical distance can be estimated and plotted using ``AtmPlumeEnsemble`` keyword. Both types of plots produce a map-view of the release area for each time step. It is recommended that *{time_index}* modifier is provided to the ``savefig`` keyword argument so that an image for each time-step plot produced can be saved in a separate file."
ControlFile_ex10.yaml,"Lookup table based reservoir, cemented wellbore, deep alluvium aquifer","Latin hypercube sampling, 30 realizations. Example illustrates a setup connecting lookup table based reservoir, wellbore and aquifer impact components."
ControlFile_ex11.yaml,"Simple reservoir, multisegmented wellbore, carbonate aquifer",Forward simulation. The saturation/pressure output produced by simple reservoir model is used to drive leakage from five multisegmented wellbore models separated into two groups according to their properties. Two carbonate aquifer components are linked to both groups of wellbores and estimate the impact from the leakage of |CO2| and brine into the aquifers 1 and 2.

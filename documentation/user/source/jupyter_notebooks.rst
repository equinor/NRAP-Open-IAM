NRAP-Open-IAM has multiple examples illustrating functionality and applications
of the tool for different types of applicable interfaces.
In the folder *examples/Jupyter_notebooks* there are a number of Jupyter
notebooks (https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) that provide guidance on the
possible use cases and workflows. Some of these materials are
included as part of documentation (available online only).

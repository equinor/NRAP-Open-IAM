"Limited flexibility in specifying layer thicknesses","Deviations from full physics simulations due to analytical nature of the model","The ROM was derived from short-time simulations. Simulations were terminated after 1,000-time steps or 100 hours, whichever came first. It should not be used for long term predictions if leakage rate is high and would result in significant mass loss from reservoir."
"Limited flexibility in specifying the number of thief zones (only 1 thief zone supported)","Large shale thicknesses, ""Large wellbore segment length for shale (or cap rock) layers may lead to errors due to the nature of the analytical approach employed. Less than 100 m for each segment is recommended with the current model. Although a particular combination of model parameters can relax the degree of the error or enlarge the applicable length of the segment, the quality of the performance is not guaranteed with large segment lengths.""",
"Limitations on total reservoir pressure change. Reservoir pressure changes greater than 9.3 MPa are outside the bounds of the model. Pressure changes in saline aquifers are typically below this range. However, pressure changes can be larger than this range in other formations that are more limited in extent (e.g., depleted gas fields)","No leakage of |CO2| in intermediate aquifers, ""The analytical model does not consider the lateral leakage into intermediate aquifers, resulting in zero accumulation of |CO2| in intermediate aquifers. All the |CO2| is transported to the topmost aquifer, yielding an overestimation of the amount of |CO2| leaking into the topmost aquifer. Residual brine saturation can be used as a proxy for lateral leakage into intermediate aquifers. Users can calibrate this parameter to yield a desirable |CO2| leakage rate/mass into the thief layers (intermediate aquifers). The parameter would have to be recalibrated if any of the other input parameters, like reservoir pressure, well permeability, etc., are changed.""",

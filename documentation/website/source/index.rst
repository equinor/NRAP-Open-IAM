NRAP-Open-IAM: Open Source Integrated Assessment Model
######################################################

NRAP-Open-IAM is an open-source software product that enables quantification
of containment effectiveness and leakage risk at storage sites in the context
of system uncertainties and variability. NRAP-Open-IAM represents
the next-generation in a line of systems-based computational models developed
for quantitative geological carbon storage (GCS) risk assessment. The model
comprises a set of reduced-order and analytical models of various components
of the GCS system, potential leakage pathways, receptors of concern including
impact to groundwater resources and the atmosphere, a framework to support
stochastic simulation, time stepping, uncertainty quantification, other
analytical functionality for scenario and risk-performance evaluation, and
a basic graphical user interface to support scenario development, data input
simulation definition, and basic post-processing and results display. As the
NRAP Open-IAM functionality continues to evolve, we continue to add to
its capability to develop quantitative, probabilistic, and time-dependent
profiles of the evolution of risk at a GCS site and evaluate the influence
of uncertain parameters on uncertainty in predicted risk. It can be used
to quantify the dynamics of reservoir saturation plume and pressure-affected
area, for evaluation of the area of potential groundwater impact (i.e.,
Area of Review) and monitoring requirements to support cost and regulatory
analysis, and for consideration of different post-injection site care and
closure scenarios.
